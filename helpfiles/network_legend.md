***
<b>Nodes:</b> Kinases are represented by yellow circles, and phosphosites or proteins are depicted as squares. Colors of squares signify differential phosphorylation with red indicating higher phosphorylation in case samples and blue indicating higher phosphorylation in control samples.

<b>Edges:</b> Black arrows represent targets of the kinase. Nodes that are connected by yellow edges to a kinase indicate the corresponding phosphosites or proteins for a kinase. For phosphosites, it signifies the phosphosite is on the kinase sequence. For proteins, it denotes the protein name of that kinase and displays its phosphorylation status.
